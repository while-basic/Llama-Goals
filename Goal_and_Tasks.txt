Task 005: Design and implement the AI system architecture
Description:  1. Use 'execute_code' and 'read_file' to design the AI system architecture based on the system requirements and preprocessed datasets. 2. Implement the machine learning algorithms, natural language processing techniques, and ethical safeguards. 3. Test the implemented AI system for meaningful conversation and ethical safeguards.
Tools: execute_code, read_file
Success Factors: AI system architecture is designed and implemented, demonstrating the ability to engage in meaningful conversation and ethical safeguards.
